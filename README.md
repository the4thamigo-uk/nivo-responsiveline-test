## Performance testing Nivo ResponsiveLine


The basic [demo](https://the4thamigo-uk.github.io/nivo-responsiveline-test/index.html), loads a nivo ResponsiveLine with 2000 points.

    npm install
    webpack

Comparing the interactive tooltip speed against [this](https://canvasjs.com/docs/charts/intro/high-performance-javascript-charts/) chart suggests nivo is really slow.
